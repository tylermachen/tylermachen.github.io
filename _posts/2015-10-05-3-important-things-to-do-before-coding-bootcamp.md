Well, I did it. I secured a loan, left a respectable job in Media/Advertising to pursue what I am passionate about, got accepted into an awesome Coding Bootcamp, did all of the things they told me to do, made it through project mode, and now only have one week left as a student until I venture out in the pursuit of (happiness) my first job as a developer.

<a href="http://flatironschool.com/?gclid=CP243O37icgCFQmPHwod008GAA">Flatiron School</a>, I salute you. You have exceeded my expectations and have delivered on your promises. That being said, there was no magic. Getting through the program was challenging and I have spent the last three months programming all day and night.

This blog post is for those thinking about putting their life on hold to attend a Coding Bootcamp. Below are 3 things that, based on my personal experience or that of my classmates, will help you succeed if you decide to go through with it.

## 1) Ask Yourself, Do I Even Like Programming?

Lately, I have been seeing loads of ads popping up around the Internet for Coding Bootcamps/Courses that promise to take people with no experience and turn them into developers in a few weeks time with some fairy dust. They usual go on to say that one can demand a six-figure salary to top it off. All you have to do is pay them money, show up, and VOILA! you are a boss programmer. These claims are false.

If you are thinking about programming just because it's popular or because you think you can make more than your current job, you should ask yourself if you ACTUALLY like programming for programming or if you are forcing yourself to be interested in it because of the money or the IDEA of what it means to be someone that knows how to code.

Furthermore, Media makes coding look super badass and easy and has been ramping up its codecentric programming in recent years (e.g. <a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/mrrobot">Mr. Robot</a>, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley">Silicon Valley</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2717822/">Black Hat</a>, <a href="http://www.nick.com/game-shakers/">Nickelodeon's Game Shakers</a> and <a href="http://www.nick.com/games/nickelodeon-coding-kickoff.html">Coding Kickoff</a>).

Coding <i>is</i> cool, but not in the glamorous way the Media portrays it. Coding is hard, and takes a HUGE amount of time and dedication. Nothing <i>just</i> works. Hours of blood, sweat, and tears are spent staring at a computer screen just to realize you forgot a semi-colon. Moreover, you will spend all day working on a problem that you may not solve by the end of it. You will then go to sleep feeling defeated. The only thing that will keep you going is a true passion for the craft. So you should ask yourself.

* Do I even like programming?
* Why am I thinking about attending a Coding Bootcamp?
* What are my goals after the program?

Spend some time researching and going through online tutorials and decide if a career as a developer is really what you are looking for.

## 2) Get Your Personal Affairs Together

Coding Bootcamps are intense. If you are planning to attend, you should be ready to dedicate your life to the program while it is in session. This means that you should take care of any personal issues before attending.

Some questions to ask yourself...

* Do I have a stable place to live during the program?
* Are my finances all set to take care of living expenses and the cost of the program?
* Do I have any family or friend obligations coming up that may cause me to be absent?

Essentially, the program should be your top priority. There are no grades or certificates. What you get out of the program is what you put in. Things may arise that are out of your control but you should do whatever you can to avoid missing class. You will be covering a lot of subjects and it's easy to fall behind.

## 3) Start Teaching Yourself ASAP

As mentioned earlier, you will be covering a lot of subjects in a short amount of time. In order to get the most out of the program and to maximize your chance of success, I recommend learning as much as you can when it comes to actual programming so that you are not caught off-guard by the rapid pace of the course.

This means not going into the program with no experience. I'm not saying you need to already know everything about programming to succeed (then why would you be going to school in the first place), but at least take a few months, or more if time permits, to familiarize yourself with as many concepts as you can. I have listed some great online resources to get you started below (don't be afraid of picking up some books too).

Also, it's important to note that most programs offer some pre-work to get you ramped up before the on-site classes begin. Take the pre-work seriously and do it all. Depending on the timing of your acceptance into the program, you may not have as much time as you need to complete the pre-work. Instead of saying screw it and jumping into the upcoming class, I recommend attending a later cohort so that you have more time to get a good foundation that you can build upon during the program.

If time permits, the best way to learn is to build something. Build anything. Take what you have learned from the resources above and make something. This will solidify what you have learned by giving you more context for WHY things are done a certain way. You will also inevitably run into issues with your app and will learn to be more resourceful and improve your problem solving abilities.

### Learn Things You Didn't Know You Need To Know

Learn about Test Driven Development (TDD) as early as you can while you have more time. Knowing the purpose of TDD and how to test ones code is essential for any developer.
